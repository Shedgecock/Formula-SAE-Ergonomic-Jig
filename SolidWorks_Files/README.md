2. **Assembly Files**: Complete assemblies combining multiple parts to create the jig.
3. **Configurations**: Predefined settings and variations of parts/assemblies for testing and analysis.

## Usage

- Open these files using SolidWorks 2024 or compatible versions.
- Refer to the [Engineering Analysis](https://github.com/Shedgecock/Formula-SAE-Ergonomic-Jig/blob/a6188684190f81b6f10be2cc678db0f85ad69125/Engineering%20Analysis.pdf) file for technical context and analysis.
- Use these files to view, modify, or analyze the project's design.
